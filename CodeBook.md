# Study design
This section of the document will explain how the original data was transformed into a tidy data set.

## Original data files
Before the data was combined or modified in any way, it contained the following files:

.:

* activity_labels.txt
* features_info.txt
* features.txt
* filelist.txt
* README.txt

./test:

* subject_test.txt
* X_test.txt
* y_test.txt

./test/Inertial Signals:

* body_acc_x_test.txt
* body_acc_y_test.txt
* body_acc_z_test.txt
* body_gyro_x_test.txt
* body_gyro_y_test.txt
* body_gyro_z_test.txt
* total_acc_x_test.txt
* total_acc_y_test.txt
* total_acc_z_test.txt

./train:

* subject_train.txt
* X_train.txt
* y_train.txt

./train/Inertial Signals:

* body_acc_x_train.txt
* body_acc_y_train.txt
* body_acc_z_train.txt
* body_gyro_x_train.txt
* body_gyro_y_train.txt
* body_gyro_z_train.txt
* total_acc_x_train.txt
* total_acc_y_train.txt
* total_acc_z_train.txt
